    JavaScript supports three important types of dialog boxes. These dialog boxes can be used 
to raise and alert, or to get confirmation on any input or to have a kind of input from the 
users. Here we will discuss each dialog box one by one.
Alert DialogBox
An alert dialog box is mostly used to send a warning message to the users. For example, 
if one input field requires to enter some text but the user does not provide any input, then 
as a part of validation, you can use an alert box to send a warning message. 
Nonetheless, an alert box can still be used for friendlier messages. Alert box provides only 
one button "OK" to select and proceed.
